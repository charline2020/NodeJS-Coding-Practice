# Personal NodeJS Practice Notes

Hi! Welcome to my Node.js practice repository! I've dedicated two days a week to learning this exciting programming language, and after three months of hard work, I've completed this project. 

**Please take a look and feel free to provide feedback on areas where I can improve in the future. Your input is valuable to me!**

# Introduction

The overall tutorial covers several concepts and examples, such as:

- Node.js introductions
-  npm
-  nvm
-  Express
-  EJS
-  MongoDB
-  Mongoose
-  RESTful API
-  Cookie management
-  Session handling
-  Token authentication

## Final project

You can find the final project in the **project** folder. It's a simple website for managing accounting book records where you can login, logout, create, and delete records. The project is linked to MongoDB for data storage.
